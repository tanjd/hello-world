    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Python keywords cannot be used as variable names. You can find the list of Python keywords in the table below.</li>\n",
    "    <li>A variable name cannot contain any space.</li>\n",
    "    <li>The first character of a variable name must be a letter or an underscore character (i.e., `_`), and the remaining characters must be a letter, a digit, or an underscore character.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "| Keywords | | | | | | | | | |\n",
    "| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n",
    "| False | class | finally | is | return | None | continue | for | lambda | try |\n",

    "Besides the rules above, we generally should also follow some naming conventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>A variable name should be meaningful and represent what it stores. Names such as `score`, `age` and `price` are good but names such as `s`, `a` and `p` are not good. Usually variable names are nouns.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Use lowercase letters to name variables. If a variable name contains multiple words, use underscore characters to join the words. E.g., `home_address`, `first_name`, `conversion_rate`.</li>\n",
